Hello, welcome to my personal blog! If you couldn't already tell, my name is Dan Harris and this is the blog where I post thoughts or discuss non-technical topics. Technical posts can be found on my [technology blog](https://danmharris.com/posts/).

A little about myself, I am 20 years old and currently in my third year of Computer Science at the University of Southampton. Next summer I will be
moving to Bath to work full time for [Netcraft](https://netcraft.com) as a software developer.
