Hi, my name is Dan and  I am currently 19 years old and studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton. This is my personal blog where I plan on sharing different aspects of my life. Whether that be what I'm currently up to at University, any adventures I go on or my general opinion on things happening in the world. I also have a <a href="http://blog.danmharris.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology Blog</a> where my inner geek shines and I discuss technological projects that I'm working on.
